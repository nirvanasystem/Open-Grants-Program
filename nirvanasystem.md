## Project Description :page_facing_up: 

Nirvana System (NIR) is the world’s first smart contract system based on the Polkadot network that supports leverage and derivatives transactions. You can use the wallet to connect to the Nirvana System to complete all processes such as lending, trading, and leverage on the chain. Set USD stable currency for settlement, and provide on-chain APIs for programmable automated strategy execution through smart contracts.

Please provide the following:
  * A brief description of the project.
  
  Nirvana System (NIR) is the world’s first smart contract system based on the Polkadot network that supports leverage and derivatives transactions. You can use the wallet to connect to the Nirvana System to complete all processes such as lending, trading, and leverage on the chain. Set USD stable currency for settlement, and provide on-chain APIs for programmable automated strategy execution through smart contracts.
  
  * An indication of why this project is good for the ecosystem.
  
  Nirvana can become the Uniswap+Compound in the Polkadot ecosystem. With the high performance of the Polkadot network, it can provide community users with a centralized exchange-like experience, allowing more users and more projects to use the Polkadot ecosystem.
  
  * An indication of how you will integrate this project into Substrate / Polkadot.
  
  Our decentralized exchange will be developed using the Substrate framework, using Polkadot's characteristics to achieve cross-chain, and the entire exchange will be presented to users in the form of DAPP.
  
  * An indication of why your team is interested in creating this project.
  
  There are obvious pain points in the DEX area:
  * Leverage and derivative transactions are not supported. Limited by the performance of the public chain itself, the product form is not as flexible as the centralized exchange (CEX), and users can still only choose the centralized exchange if they use leverage to trade
  * Most trading pairs are provided on the basis of ETH (such as: ALTS/ETH). Due to the large fluctuations in the price of ETH relative to stable currency, it is not convenient for profit calculations and arbitrage strategies
  * APIs are not supported. Transactions can only be performed manually, and robots cannot be used to automatically execute trading strategies through APIs, resulting in inactive transactions
  * The server and domain are still centralized. Once there is a problem with the domain and server, DEX still cannot be used.
  
  Now we can solve these problems.

## Additional Information :heavy_plus_sign: 
Any additional information that you think is relevant to this application that hasn't already been included.

Possible additional information to include:
* What work has been done so far?

We have completed milestone 1 and are in progress on milestone 2.

* Are there are any teams who have already contributed (financially) to the project?

Yes, the funds for completing Milestone 1 and Starting Milestone 2 are paid by volunteers themselves.

* Have you applied for other grants so far?

No.

* Are there any other projects similar to yours? If so, how is your project different?
  * Based on the performance of the Polkadot network, leverage and derivative transactions on the chain are realized. Integrate the DeFi lending system with the trading system, automatically complete mortgage lending, spot trading, risk control and other processes through smart contracts, and use the high performance of the Polkadot network to achieve borrowing, trading, and leverage similar to the centralized exchange experience All functions.
  * Provide benchmark trading pairs with stablecoins pegged to the US dollar. Solve the problem of accurate profit calculation, and no longer suffer from the price fluctuation of ETH.
  * The on-chain API is realized through the smart contract and oracle function of Polkadot. Traders use robots to communicate on the chain through oracles to write and execute automated trading strategies, which in turn stimulates the scale of the market.
  * Innovatively solve the problem of decentralization of servers and domain names. The system encourages capable users to build their own decentralized derivatives trading contract system based on the Nirvana System, share depth and liquidity, and get NIR tokens in return.

* The team's long-term plans and intentions with this project.
 
Become a DeFi version of BitMEX based on the Polkadot ecosystem.
